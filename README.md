## Components

There will be pre-existing components that only need tests written for them:

1. `ShoppingLists`
2. `ShoppingList`
3. `ShoppingListForm`

New components will need to be written, along with their tests:

1. `ShoppingListItem`
2. `ShoppingListItemForm`

The `ConfirmationButton` has tests that demonstrate its usage and prove its
functionality.s
